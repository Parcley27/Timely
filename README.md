# Timely
Timely is an app designed to help you keep track of your upcoming events. You can create events and give them descriptions, fun icons, urgency levels, and more. View all your events in a day-by-day timeline, or break them out into a month-long calendar view. Plan ahead and see how things stack up throughout your week. Mute or favourite events to choose what notifications you get, and use quick actions for total control over your schedule. Finally, customize the layout to make Timely just how you like it.

Timely works on any device running iOS 16, iPadOS 16, or MacOS 11 or later, and was designed for English (en-CA), Chinese (zh-CN & zh-TR) and, French (fr & fr-CA), and Spanish (es-MX) languages.
